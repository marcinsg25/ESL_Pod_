When I get home, 
I start on dinner right away. 
I clean off the kitchen counter 
after putting away the groceries 
and decide to make pasta.

So, I preheat the oven to 375, 
In other words, three hundred 
And seventy five  degrees Fahrenheit.
I preheat it because I want to bake the bread 
and keep the chicken hot until my wife gets home.
So,I open the oven door, 
I put in the bread, 
I put in the chicken, 
and then I close the door. 
My wife is going to be home late 
so I want to keep the chicken hot
I want to make sure that it stays hot.

So, I put some water in a pan 
and I turn the burner on high.
I'm going to boil some water.
Well, When the water starts boiling, 
when it starts to make bubbles because it is very hot 
Then I decide I want to make a salad because I'm very hungry.

Well, just as I decide to make the salad, 
Just then, my wife opens the back door and yells, I’m home!
She comes into the kitchen, 
and helps with chopping the tomatoes to add to the sauce. 
She stirs the sauce until it’s done, 
while I finish tossing the salad.

1195.9,1205.4
So,she is stirring the sauce and at the same time, 
I am finishing the salad, and I finished by tossing it. 
I get out the place mats and napkins to set the table. 
I also make sure that there is a spoon, knife, fork, and plate for each of us.

About 15 minutes later, 
we sit down at the table in the dining room 
My wife and I talk about our long day, 
meaning we had many things happen today,
and maybe we are very tired, so we had a long day.

My wife offers to do the dishes because I cooked, 
But of course, since I am a wonderful husband, 
I help out by drying the dishes.
First, I put some of the leftovers in a Tupperware container 
and some in plastic wrap and the rest in aluminum foil. 
Then I dry the pans, plates, glasses, and silverware..
The silverware, remember, is the spoon, knife, fork 
that you use when you eat.
